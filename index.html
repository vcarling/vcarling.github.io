I am a fifth-year student and research assistant at University of California, Riverside, pursuing a bachelors in Physics. My laboratory experience consists of 
both team-based and independent research projects in experimental condensed matter physics during my time in university, as well as microbiology prior.

With additional internship, lab, and industry experiences, I hope to continue in the field of condensed matter physics, materials science & engineering, or 
a related area of study.
